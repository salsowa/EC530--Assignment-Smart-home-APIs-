Updated after the FastAPI conversions: 
This project is a FastAPI-based API for managing a Smart Home System, including users, houses, floors, rooms, and devices. It provides full CRUD functionality, allowing users to create, retrieve, update, and delete records for each entity. The API was originally built using a different framework but was later migrated to FastAPI to take advantage of its speed, built-in data validation, and automatic OpenAPI documentation. The project also includes unit tests with Pytest and a GitHub Actions workflow to automate testing on every push.
